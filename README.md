Used tailwind css for styling, first started in mobile view and moved to desktop.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

Biggest thing I learned was positioning and using tailwind css for mobile view, and understanding break points with tailwind.


### Useful resources
